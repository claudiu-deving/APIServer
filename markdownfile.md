I gave up using highlight.js since it wasn't up to my expectations,the coloring was only for a few keywords and some of the words.
I started a Parser project for converting markdown into html. More details will be added into that project's Readme. 

In this next part, I will start working on general structure of the project. 
I will use the free tier of AWS's EC2 instance and host there the Postgresql database and the server API.

Before starting the EC instance, I will use docker containers, one for the database, one for the server. 

Knowing this, the next challenge is the blogpost design.
This project will be focused more on the design/frontend part and is more personal so I want it to look right.

#### This is a heading

<code>
public static class Program
{
	public static void Main(string <3variable3>args[])
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
	}
}

    public <3class3>BlogPost(int <3variable3>id, string <3variable3>title, string <3variable3>content) {
